    The bidiagonalization Lanczos method can be used for computing a few of the
    largest or smallest singular values and corresponding singular vectors of a
    large matrix, but the method may encounter some convergence problems. In
    this paper the convergence of the method is analyzed, showing why it may
    converge erratically and perhaps fail to converge. To correct this possible
    nonconvergence and improve the method, a refined bidiagonalization Lanczos
    method is proposed. The implicitly restarting technique due to Sorensen is
    applied to the method, and an implicitly restarted refined bidiagonalization
    Lanczos algorithm (IRRBL) is developed. A new selection of shifts is
    proposed for use within IRRBL, called refined shifts, and a reliable and
    efficient algorithm is developed for computing the refined shifts. Numerical
    experiments show that IRRBL can perform better than the implicitly restarted
    bidiagonalization Lanczos algorithm (IRBL) proposed by Larsen, in particular
    when the smallest singular triplets are desired.

    Organized Research Units (ORUs) are nondepartmental units utilized by U.S.
    research universities to support interdisciplinary research initiatives,
    among other goals. This study examined the impacts of ORUs at one large
    public research university, the University of California, Davis (UC Davis),
    using a large corpus of journal article metadata and abstracts for both
    faculty affiliated with UCD ORUs and a comparison set of other faculty.
    Using regression analysis, I find that ORUs appeared to increase the number
    of coauthors of affiliated faculty, but did not appear to directly affect
    publication or citation counts. Next, I frame interdisciplinarity in terms
    of a notion of discursive space, and use a topic model approach to situate
    researchers within this discursive space. The evidence generally indicates
    that ORUs promoted multidisciplinarity rather than interdisciplinarity. In
    the conclusion, drawing on work in philosophy of science on inter- and
    multidisciplinarity, I argue that multidisciplinarity is not necessarily
    inferior to interdisciplinarity.

    Topic model is a well proven tool to investigate the semantic content of
    textual corpora. Yet corpora sometimes include texts in several languages,
    making it impossible to apply language-specific computational approaches
    over their entire content. This is the problem we encountered when setting
    to analyze a philosophy of science corpus spanning over eight decades and
    including original articles in Dutch, German and French, on top of a large
    majority of articles in English. To circumvent this multilingual problem, we
    use machine-translation tools to bulk translate non-English documents into
    English. Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these
    translations nevertheless provide correctly translated terms and preserve
    the semantic proximity of documents with respect to one another. To assess
    the quality of this translation step, we develop a “semantic topology
    preservation test” that relies on estimating the extent to which
    document-to-document distances have been preserved during translation. We
    then conduct an LDA topic-model analysis over the entire corpus of
    translated and English original texts, and compare it to a topic-model done
    over the English original texts only. We thereby identify the specific
    contribution of the translated texts. These studies reveal a more complete
    picture of main topics that can found in the philosophy of science
    literature, especially during the early days of the discipline when numerous
    articles were published in languages other than English.

    This paper demonstrates how to use the R package stm for structural topic
    modeling. The structural topic model allows researchers to flexibly estimate
    a topic model that includes document-level metadata. Estimation is
    accomplished through a fast variational approximation. The stm package
    provides many useful features, including rich ways to explore topics,
    estimate uncertainty, and visualize quantities of interest.

    Psychologists developed Multiple Factor Analysis to decompose multivariate
    data into a small number of interpretable factors without any a priori
    knowledge about those factors. In this form of factor analysis, the Varimax
    "factor rotation" is a key step to make the factors interpretable. Charles
    Spearman and many others objected to factor rotations because the factors
    seem to be rotationally invariant. These objections are still reported in
    all contemporary multivariate statistics textbooks. This is an engima
    because this vintage form of factor analysis has survived and is widely
    popular because, empirically, the factor rotation often makes the factors
    easier to interpret. We argue that the rotation makes the factors easier to
    interpret because, in fact, the Varimax factor rotation performs statistical
    inference. We show that Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the Varimax
    rotation provides a unified spectral estimation strategy for a broad class
    of modern factor models, including the Stochastic Blockmodel and a natural
    variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (i.e., "topic modeling"). In
    addition, we show that Thurstone's widely employed sparsity diagnostics
    implicitly assess a key "leptokurtic" condition that makes the rotation
    statistically identifiable in these models. Taken together, this shows that
    the know-how of Vintage Factor Analysis performs statistical inference,
    reversing nearly a century of statistical thinking on the topic. With a
    sparse eigensolver, PCA with Varimax is both fast and stable. Combined with
    Thurstone's straightforward diagnostics, this vintage approach is suitable
    for a wide array of modern applications.

  abstract: >-
    Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing
    raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often
    involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding,
    transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only
    one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which
    involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively
    processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios.
    Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and
    political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be
    misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A
    multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change
    because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to
    which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.
